Paddle Bear is a game that simulates real-life paddling. Players control their bear by tapping on one of the four corners of the screen to paddle front-left, front-right, back-left or back-right.  Timing and coordination are very crucial to its survival, as going off-screen, hitting the lands or the logs all cause sinkage. The goal is to paddle for as long as possible and to collect drowning bear cubs, which can be exchanged for new bears at the shop.

The game may seem difficult at first, but it should be beatable if you make connections with real life paddling physics. If you are an experienced paddler, you should be able to make quick progress. Pro tip: acceleration is the greatest when the paddle is fully buried in the water. To achieve maximum speed or rotation, don't let it drag and snap it out right when it's passed that stage.

Hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed making it :)
